# CPP-STL

STL is a C++ library that provides four components:

- [Containers](#1-containers)
- [Algorithms](#2-algorithms)
- [Iterators](#3-iterators)
- [Functions](#4-functions)

## 1. Containers

*Containers are used to store data. They are objects that hold data and provide a way to access it. The data is stored in a container in a specific format. The format depends on the type of container. The data can be accessed using iterators.*

* [pair](pair.md)
* [vector](vector.md)
* [maps](maps.md)
* [set](set.md)
* [stack](stack.md)
* [queue](queue.md)
* [priority_queue](priority_queue.md)

## 2. Algorithms

*Algorithms are a collection of functions that perform specific operations on ranges of elements.*

* [sort](Algorithms.md/#sorting)
* [reverse](Algorithms.md/#reverse)
* [find](Algorithms.md/#find)
* [binary_search](Algorithms.md/#binary_search)
* [lower_bound](Algorithms.md/#lower_bound)
* [upper_bound](Algorithms.md/#upper_bound)
* [max_element](Algorithms.md/#max_element)
* [min_element](Algorithms.md/#min_element)



## 3. Iterators

*Iterators are objects that point to elements in a range. They are used to access the elements of a container. Iterators are used to point to the beginning and the end of a range of elements. They are used to access the elements of a container. Iterators are used to point to the beginning and the end of a range of elements.*

* [begin](iterators.md/#begin)
* [end](iterators.md/#end)
* [rbegin](iterators.md/#rbegin)
* [rend](iterators.md/#rend)
